Replace With Alphabet Position
<br>
Welcome.
<br><br>
In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.
<br>
If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.
<br><br>
"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.
<br><br>
Example
<br><br>
alphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
<br>
Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )
